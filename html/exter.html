            <h1><span class="title">Alexandra Exter</span></h1>
<p>Aleksandra Aleksándrovna Ekster, also known as Alexandra Exter, was a Ukrainian-Russian artist, painter and designer linked to cubo-futurism, suprematism and constructivism who lived between kyiv, Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Vienna and Paris.</p>
<p>Exter was a relevant figure of the first avant-garde art in Russia. She came into contact with cubists and futurists in Paris and assimilated and reinterpreted these new trends, later spreading them in her native land.</p>
<h2>Russian avant-garde</h2>
<p>Under the avant-garde umbrella, Ekster has been noted to be a suprematist and constructivist painter as well as a major influencer of the Art Deco movement.</p>
<p>While not confined within a particular movement, Ekster was one of the most experimental women of the avant-garde. Ekster absorbed from many sources and cultures in order to develop her own original style. In 1915–1916, she worked in the peasant craft cooperatives in the villages Skoptsi and Verbovka along with Kazimir Malevich, Yevgenia Pribylskaya, Natalia Davidova, Nina Genke, Liubov Popova, Ivan Puni, Olga Rozanova, Nadezhda Udaltsova and others. Ekster later founded a teaching and production workshop (MDI) in Kyiv (1918–1920). Alexander Tyshler, Vadym Meller, Anatol Petrytsky, Kliment Red'ko, Tchelitchew, Shifrin, Nikritin worked there. Also during this period she was one of the leading stage designers of Alexander Tairov's Chamber Theatre.</p>
<h2>Emigration</h2>
<p>(<em>Later life</em>)</p>
<p><h3><strong>1920-1930</strong></h3> In 1924, Aleksandra Ekster and her husband emigrated to France and settled in Paris, where she initially became a professor at the Academie Moderne. From 1926 to 1930, Ekster was a professor at Fernand Léger's Académie d'Art Contemporain. In 1933, she began creating beautiful and original illuminated manuscripts (gouache on paper), perhaps the most important works of the last phase of her life. The "Callimaque" manuscript (c. 1939, the text being a French translation of a hymn by Hellenistic poet Callimachus) is widely regarded as her masterpiece. In 1936, she participated in the exhibition Cubism and Abstract Art in New York and went on to have solo exhibitions in Prague and in Paris. She was a book illustrator for the publishing company Flammarion in Paris from 1936 until her death in the Paris suburb of Fontenay-aux-Roses. During the past few decades, her reputation has increased dramatically, as have the prices of her works. As a consequence, several fakes have appeared on the market in recent years.</p>
